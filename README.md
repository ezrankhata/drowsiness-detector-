I recently completed a drowsiness detection system that combines Python, OpenCV, dlib, and Arduino to help prevent fatigue-related accidents.

This project uses a live camera feed to track facial landmarks, calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) in real-time, and triggers audio-visual alerts—including a buzzer and LED—when drowsiness is detected:

 
This formula (Euclidean distance) enables precise measurement between eye landmarks, making detection accurate and responsive.

Globally, a huge number of people lose their lives or suffer serious injuries every year due to drowsy driving and operating equipment while fatigued, with consequences that extend far beyond the road.

✅ Machine Operators – Preventing microsleeps during operation of heavy equipment
✅ Control Rooms – Supporting staff monitoring critical infrastructure
✅ Healthcare – Assisting caregivers during long shifts
✅ Aviation – Adding a safety layer for pilots and technicians

By integrating computer vision with Arduino hardware, this system shows how accessible technology can help protect lives and enhance workplace safety.
